These files were more than likely all scanned with a [Revopoint Miraco Plus 3D Scanner](https://www.revopoint3d.com/pages/all-in-one-3d-scanner-miracoplus) and I'm using the [RevoScan5](https://www.revopoint3d.com/pages/support-download?srsltid=AfmBOoraicuEHaJrJ4TD3ZhJBCnPl7nlPH4-kS0I0GI8fzXNS_invXQI) software to do any sort of point-cloud/mesh cleanup.

I am using the [OEM GM Parts ACDelco website](https://parts.gmparts.com/) for OEM part numbers.

**File Format**: In most cases the file(s) will be named: *'Description'* + '_' + *'OEM Number'* + '_' + *'ScannedDate'* + '_' + *'RevoScanProjectNumber'* + '_' + *'type'*, for example the driver side fog lamp filename for a mesh looks like this: "DriverSideFogLamp_84770637_20250712_170101_mesh"
